<b>INGREDIENTS</b>
1 cup rice
2 tablespoon ghee
2 pinches asafoetida
1 1/2 sprigs curry leaves
5 cashews
water as required
3 pinches turmeric
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
2 teaspoon ginger paste
1 cup moong dal
<b>METHOD</b>
Step 1
Here's how you can prepare this delicious recipe at home: Take a pan and add moong dal in it. Dry roast till it turns golden and aromatic. Wash the same under running water and transfer it in a deep pan along with rice and enough water to submerge both. Bring it to a boil and turn off the flame, once well-cooked. Add salt according to your taste and keep aside.

Step 2
Next, place a pan on medium flame and pour ghee. Once heated, add cashews and fry until they change their color to golden brown. Once done, take out and keep aside and warm. Now, add ginger in the pan and fry for a minute or two. Put cumin seeds, ginger paste, curry leaves and black pepper along with turmeric powder and asafoetida. Add the dal-rice mixture and stir well for about 5 minutes.

Step 3
Then simmer for about 3-4 minutes on medium flame. Lastly, turn off the flame and transfer to a serving dish. Garnish with cashews. To make it look even more eye-grabbing, you can serve it with some slightly fried coconut slices, dry curry leaves and some roasted red chillies to spice up this traditional South Indian recipe. Serve this easy Pongal Recipe with Vada and Sambhar.
