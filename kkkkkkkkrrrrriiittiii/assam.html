<b>INGREDIENTS</b>

6 duck legs, halved
1/2 cup coconut cream
3 tsp sea salt
3 tbsp vegetable oil
11/2 cups coconut milk
1/2 cup of water
juice of 1 lemon
1/4 tsp freshly ground white pepper
5 red shallots, finely sliced and deep-fried until golden
coriander leaves, to serve

For curry paste
10 long red chillies, deseeded and chopped
10 dried long red chillies, deseeded, soaked in warm water for 30 minutes and chopped
2 lemongrass stalks, tough outer leaves removed, chopped
3 red shallots, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped

<b>METHOD</b>

For the curry paste, pound the chillies, lemongrass, shallots and garlic in a mortar with a pestle until you have a fine paste. Alternatively, you can use a blender to process the ingredients, adding a little water if necessary.

In a bowl, mix the duck leg pieces with the coconut cream and salt. Heat the oil in a heavy-based pot and stir-fry the paste for 10 minutes or until fragrant.

Add the duck and stir-fry for a further 5 minutes, or until the coconut cream "splits".

Stir in the coconut milk and water and allow to simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 1 hour or until the curry has thickened slightly and a layer of oil has risen to the surface.

Season the curry with lemon juice and freshly ground pepper. Sprinkle with fried shallots and coriander leaves, and serve with steamed rice.
